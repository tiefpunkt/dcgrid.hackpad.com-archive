# Single Wire Earth Return (SWER)

**Single wire earth return** (SWER) or **single wire ground return** is a [single-wire transmission line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-wire_transmission_line) which supplies [single-phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-phase_electric_power)  [electrical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power) from an [electrical grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid) to remote areas at low cost. Its distinguishing feature is that the [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_(electricity)) (or sometimes a body of water) is used as the return path for the current, to avoid the need for a second wire (or [_neutral wire_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_and_neutral)) to act as a return path.
