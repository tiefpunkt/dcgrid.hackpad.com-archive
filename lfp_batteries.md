# LFP batteries

The **lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery**, also called **LFP battery** (with "LFP" standing for "lithium ferrophosphate"), is a type of[rechargeable battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery), specifically a [lithium-ion battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery), which uses [LiFePO4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate) as a [cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode) material. LiFePO4 batteries have somewhat lower [energy density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density) than the more common [LiCoO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_cobalt_oxide) design found in consumer electronics, but offers longer lifetimes, better [power density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_density) (the rate that energy can be drawn from them) and are inherently safer. LiFePO4 is finding a number of roles in vehicle use and backup power.
