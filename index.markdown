This is a try to resurrect the DC Grid Hackpad, which contained a lot of information that might be interesting to the [AltPwr](http://altpwr.net) project as well as everyone else interested in DC microgrids.

Content was restored from the WayBack Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20170429032643/https://dcgrid.hackpad.com/
