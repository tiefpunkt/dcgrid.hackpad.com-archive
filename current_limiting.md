# Current limiting

**Current limiting** is the practice in electrical or [electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics)  [circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit) of imposing an upper limit on the [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current) that may be delivered to a [load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_electric_load) with the purpose of protecting the circuit generating or transmitting the current from harmful effects due to a [short-circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit) or similar problem in the [load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_load).



A DC grid requires:
* Active current limiting, through switching
* * Passive current limiting through cirquit breakers or fuses (choose depending on safetey and TCO)
