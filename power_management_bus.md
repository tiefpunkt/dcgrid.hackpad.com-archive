# Power Management Bus
The **Power Management Bus** (PMBus) is a variant of the [System Management Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Bus) (SMBus) which is targeted at digital management of [power supplies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_power_supply). Like SMBus, it is a relatively slow speed two wire [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol) based on [IÂ²C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C). Unlike either of those standards, it defines a substantial number of domain-specific commands rather than just saying how to communicate using commands defined by the reader.

Alternates: [CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus)
