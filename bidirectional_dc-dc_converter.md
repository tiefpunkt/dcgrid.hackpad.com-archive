# Bidirectional DC-DC converter

Bi-directional DC to DC voltage convertors typically convert a lower DC voltage (i.e. 12-48V) into a higher one (i.e. 100-400V) and vice-versa, at high (+95%) efficiency. These devices could be used in a decentralized grid system to allow for efficient transfer of energy over longer distances and to provide isolation.

## Existing systems

Several modules exist with this functionality, most of which find their typical usage in the electrical automobile industry for applications like regenerative breaking.
