# Conferences/events

For a succesful truly Open Source project it is essential to actively involve the community, spreading knowledge and reaping the benefits of collaboration in terms of contributions (fixes, upgrades, customizations and refinements).

It happends there are several upcoming events during which it might be worthwhile to present the concept, have an open discussion about implementation details, receive feedback and establish connections with both business parties as well as individual creative technologists (a.k.a. hackers).

## POC21 - Open Sourcing Sustainability

August 15 - September 9, Paris

After decades of talks on climate change and resource depletion, little has changed. Political leaders seem to be going in circles, and protest culture lacks a blueprint for the future. In 2015, it is time to move from protests to prototypes.

Instead of a _Conference Of Parties_, we propose a _Proof Of Concept_.
